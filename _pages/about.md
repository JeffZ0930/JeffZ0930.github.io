I'm currently an MSCS student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof. [Gang Wang](https://gangw.cs.illinois.edu/) in the [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/). My research interests include applying AI into security and privacy-related tasks. My past reserach projects involved using diffusion models, Large Language Models, and AI Agent on real-world security scenarios such as identity de-anonymization and phishing SMS detection. I'm also interested in building explainable and reliable LLMs/Agents for cybersafety (e.g., safe code generation).
